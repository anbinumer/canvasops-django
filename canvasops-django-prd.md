# CanvasOps Django LTI ‚Äì Product Requirements Document
**Version:** 2.0 (Django Migration)  
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Owner:** ACU Learning Technology Team  
**Created:** January 2025

---

## üéØ 1. Executive Summary

CanvasOps is migrating from React prototype to production-ready Python/Django LTI application for seamless Canvas integration. This eliminates CORS restrictions, provides native Canvas authentication, and leverages existing Python Canvas automation scripts.

### Key Changes from Phase 1
- **LTI 1.3 Integration** for native Canvas embedding
- **Python/Django backend** with existing script compatibility
- **Canvas API SDK** for robust API interactions
- **Production deployment** on cloud infrastructure

### Lessons Learned & Best Practices
- Use the latest compatible version of pylti1p3 (2.0.0 as of this project); older versions may not install or import correctly.
- Always generate and reference the correct private/public keys. Ensure file names and paths match your config.
- All LTI config URLs (login, launch, JWK) must match the deployed app's HTTPS URL exactly.
- Double-check Client ID and Deployment ID in both lti_config.json and Canvas Developer Key.
- For local testing, use ngrok or Railway HTTPS to avoid SameSite cookie and CORS issues.

### UI/UX Lessons Learned (Landing Page)
- Always confirm which Django template is being rendered for each route before making UI changes. Use codebase search or view logic to verify.
- If multiple apps (e.g., 'tools' and 'lti') have similarly named templates, update all relevant files or unify them to avoid confusion.
- After updating templates, always commit, push, and redeploy before checking production.
- Use Tailwind CSS via CDN for rapid prototyping and modern UI, but ensure the CDN link is present in the deployed template.
- Hard refresh the browser and clear any CDN or platform cache after deployment to see changes.
- For AI agents: Always check both the view logic and template directory structure before making UI edits. Document which template is mapped to which route.
- For human developers: If changes don't show up, check for template caching, static file issues, or mismatched template paths.

## üìù 15. Lessons Learned & Best Practices

### LTI & Canvas Integration
- Use the latest compatible version of pylti1p3 (2.0.0 as of this project); older versions may not install or import correctly.
- Always generate and reference the correct private/public keys. Ensure file names and paths match your config.
- All LTI config URLs (login, launch, JWK) must match the deployed app's HTTPS URL exactly.
- Double-check Client ID and Deployment ID in both lti_config.json and Canvas Developer Key.
- For local testing, use ngrok or Railway HTTPS to avoid SameSite cookie and CORS issues.

### Django & Hosting
- Store all secrets and config in Railway environment variables, not in code.
- Be aware of Railway free tier limitations (sleep after inactivity, quotas).
- Enable debug logging for pylti1p3 in Django settings for troubleshooting.

### General Development
- Document every error and fix; most LTI issues are config-related and cryptic.
- Test each step (key generation, config, launch) in isolation before combining.
- Sometimes Canvas caches Developer Key/app config‚Äîclear cache or re-add the app if changes don't show.

### Best Practices for Future LTI Tools
- Start with a working LTI 1.3 launch before building tool features.
- Automate key generation and config file creation where possible.
- Keep a checklist for Canvas Developer Key, LTI config, and environment variables.
- Use Railway or similar for quick HTTPS deployment/testing.
- Plan for free tier limitations in both dev and pilot phases.

### UI/UX Lessons Learned (Landing Page)
- Always confirm which Django template is being rendered for each route before making UI changes. Use codebase search or view logic to verify.
- If multiple apps (e.g., 'tools' and 'lti') have similarly named templates, update all relevant files or unify them to avoid confusion.
- After updating templates, always commit, push, and redeploy before checking production.
- Use Tailwind CSS via CDN for rapid prototyping and modern UI, but ensure the CDN link is present in the deployed template.
- Hard refresh the browser and clear any CDN or platform cache after deployment to see changes.
- For AI agents: Always check both the view logic and template directory structure before making UI edits. Document which template is mapped to which route.
- For human developers: If changes don't show up, check for template caching, static file issues, or mismatched template paths.
