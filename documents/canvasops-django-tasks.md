## ‚úÖ Definition of Done Criteria

Each sprint is complete when:
- All tasks are implemented and tested
- Code is reviewed and merged to main
- Railway deployment is successful
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Documentation is updated
- Performance meets free tier requirements

**Total Timeline: 8 weeks**
**Team Size: 1-2 developers**
**Infrastructure Cost: $0**

## üìù Retrospective & Lessons Learned

- Use the latest compatible pylti1p3 version (2.0.0); older versions may fail to install or import.
- Key generation and config file paths must match exactly.
- All LTI config URLs must use the deployed app's HTTPS address.
- Double-check Client ID and Deployment ID in both lti_config.json and Canvas Developer Key.
- Enable debug logging for pylti1p3 in Django for troubleshooting.
- Document every error and fix; most LTI issues are config-related.
- Test each step in isolation before combining.
- Canvas may cache Developer Key/app config‚Äîclear cache or re-add the app if changes don't show.
- Plan for Railway free tier limitations (sleep, quotas) in dev and pilot phases.
- [x] Remove private key from version control (git history and .gitignore)

## üìù UI/UX Retrospective
- Always verify which template is rendered for each route before making UI changes.
- If multiple templates exist for similar pages, update all or unify them.
- Commit, push, and redeploy after template changes.
- Use Tailwind CSS CDN for rapid UI prototyping.
- Hard refresh and clear cache after deployment.
- For AI agents: Check view logic and template mapping before editing.
- For humans: If changes don't show, check for template caching or path mismatches.
- **NEW:** Use emotional support language in tool UIs to build user trust and confidence.

## Lessons Learnt

- If a Django view renders a template that expects session variables, always provide default values in the context to avoid 500 errors when session data is missing.
- Having multiple templates with the same name (e.g., tool_selection.html) in both project-level and app-level directories can cause ambiguity. Remove or rename unused templates to ensure Django uses the correct one.
- Always check the server logs (not just HTTP logs) for Python tracebacks to diagnose 500 errors.
- After making changes to template locations or context, redeploy and test the affected views to confirm the fix.
