# CanvasOps Django LTI ‚Äì Product Requirements Document
**Version:** 2.0 (Django Migration)  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Owner:** ACU Learning Technology Team  
**Created:** January 2025

---

## üéØ 1. Executive Summary

CanvasOps is migrating from React prototype to production-ready Python/Django LTI application for seamless Canvas integration. This eliminates CORS restrictions, provides native Canvas authentication, and leverages existing Python Canvas automation scripts.

### Key Changes from Phase 1
- **LTI 1.3 Integration** for native Canvas embedding
- **Python/Django backend** with existing script compatibility
- **Canvas API SDK** for robust API interactions
- **Production deployment** on cloud infrastructure

### Lessons Learned & Best Practices
- Use the latest compatible version of pylti1p3 (2.0.0 as of this project); older versions may not install or import correctly.
- Always generate and reference the correct private/public keys. Ensure file names and paths match your config.
- All LTI config URLs (login, launch, JWK) must match the deployed app's HTTPS URL exactly.
- Double-check Client ID and Deployment ID in both lti_config.json and Canvas Developer Key.
- For local testing, use ngrok or Railway HTTPS to avoid SameSite cookie and CORS issues.
- **NEW:** Always confirm which Django template is rendered for each route before making UI changes. If multiple templates exist for similar pages, update all or unify them. Commit, push, and redeploy after template changes. Use Tailwind CSS CDN for rapid UI prototyping. Hard refresh and clear cache after deployment. If changes don't show, check for template caching or path mismatches.

### UI/UX Lessons Learned (Landing Page)
- Find & Replace tool is now implemented, styled with ACU branding, and live in Canvas.
- Human-centered language and feedback are used throughout the UI.
- Tailwind CSS is loaded via CDN for rapid prototyping and modern UI.
- Commit, push, and redeploy after template changes to ensure updates are visible.
- Hard refresh the browser and clear any CDN or platform cache after deployment to see changes.
- For AI agents: Always check both the view logic and template directory structure before making UI edits. Document which template is mapped to which route.
- For human developers: If changes don't show up, check for template caching, static file issues, or mismatched template paths.

## üìù 15. Lessons Learned & Best Practices

### LTI & Canvas Integration
- Use the latest compatible version of pylti1p3 (2.0.0 as of this project); older versions may not install or import correctly.
- Always generate and reference the correct private/public keys. Ensure file names and paths match your config.
- All LTI config URLs (login, launch, JWK) must match the deployed app's HTTPS URL exactly.
- Double-check Client ID and Deployment ID in both lti_config.json and Canvas Developer Key.
- For local testing, use ngrok or Railway HTTPS to avoid SameSite cookie and CORS issues.

### Django & Hosting
- Store all secrets and config in Railway environment variables, not in code.
- Be aware of Railway free tier limitations (sleep after inactivity, quotas).
- Enable debug logging for pylti1p3 in Django settings for troubleshooting.

### General Development
- Document every error and fix; most LTI issues are config-related and cryptic.
- Test each step (key generation, config, launch) in isolation before combining.
- Sometimes Canvas caches Developer Key/app config‚Äîclear cache or re-add the app if changes don't show.

### Best Practices for Future LTI Tools
- Start with a working LTI 1.3 launch before building tool features.
- Automate key generation and config file creation where possible.
- Keep a checklist for Canvas Developer Key, LTI config, and environment variables.
- Use Railway or similar for quick HTTPS deployment/testing.
- Plan for free tier limitations in both dev and pilot phases.

### UI/UX Lessons Learned (Landing Page)
- Always confirm which Django template is being rendered for each route before making UI changes. Use codebase search or view logic to verify.
- If multiple apps (e.g., 'tools' and 'lti') have similarly named templates, update all relevant files or unify them to avoid confusion.
- After updating templates, always commit, push, and redeploy before checking production.
- Use Tailwind CSS via CDN for rapid prototyping and modern UI, but ensure the CDN link is present in the deployed template.
- Hard refresh the browser and clear any CDN or platform cache after deployment to see changes.
- For AI agents: Always check both the view logic and template directory structure before making UI edits. Document which template is mapped to which route.
- For human developers: If changes don't show up, check for template caching, static file issues, or mismatched template paths.

### 2025 Update: First-Time Developer Checklist & Troubleshooting

**Environment Variables:**
- Always set `DATABASE_URL` using actual values, not placeholders. Example:
  `postgres://myuser:mypassword@myhost:5432/mydatabase`
- Do not use `postgres://PGUSER:PGPASSWORD@PGHOST:PGPORT/PGDATABASE` (these are placeholders, not real values).
- Ensure all required secrets (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `REDIS_URL`, Canvas LTI keys) are present in your deployment environment.

**Django Middleware Order:**
- `SessionMiddleware` must come **before** any middleware that accesses `request.session` (e.g., `LTIEmbeddingMiddleware`).
- If you see `'WSGIRequest' object has no attribute 'session'`, check your `MIDDLEWARE` order in `settings.py`.

**Template Troubleshooting:**
- If you have multiple apps with templates of the same name, Django may render the wrong one. Remove duplicates or use app-specific template paths.
- If template changes don't show up, check for browser cache, CDN cache, or template path mismatches.

**Deployment Tips:**
- After changing environment variables or settings, always redeploy your app.
- Use Railway logs to debug 500 errors‚Äîmost are due to misconfigured environment variables or database issues.
- If you see a database connection error, double-check your `DATABASE_URL` and database credentials.

**LTI Launch Debugging:**
- If the LTI tool launches but shows a blank or error page, check for session/cookie issues and ensure your app is served over HTTPS.
- Use the `/tools/tool_selection/` endpoint as a basic health check for LTI launches.

**General Advice:**
- Document every error and its fix for future developers.
- Keep a copy of this checklist in your repo or onboarding docs.
- Test each step (key generation, config, launch) in isolation before combining.

*Following this checklist will help future developers get CanvasOps LTI running smoothly on the first attempt!*

## Security and LTI Cookie/Iframe Fixes (2024)
- Private key removed from git history and .gitignore updated to exclude all key files.
- Django settings updated for secure cookies and iframe compatibility (SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE=None, X_FRAME_OPTIONS=ALLOWALL, etc.).
- LTIEmbeddingMiddleware and LTISessionMiddleware added for robust LTI session and iframe handling.
- ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable added for secure key management.
- Production-ready LTI models implemented with encryption, audit logging, and security tracking.
- LTISecurityManager class added for nonce validation, state validation, and input sanitization.
- LTIComplianceManager and LTIAdvantageServices implemented for full LTI 1.3 compliance validation.
- Cookie compatibility test template created for iframe debugging and troubleshooting.
- Security dependencies added (cryptography, django-ratelimit, sentry-sdk) for production hardening.

*This PRD serves as the foundation for migrating CanvasOps to a production-ready Python/Django LTI application with seamless Canvas integration.*

## Lessons Learned (LTI/Canvas Integration)

- **Issuer Mismatch:** Ensure the `iss` (issuer) in Canvas matches exactly in your Django `LTI_CONFIG` and `lti_config.json`.
- **Redirect URI:** The `redirect_uri` sent by your tool must match the Canvas Developer Key exactly, including trailing slashes and protocol (`https`).
- **Client ID Consistency:** The `client_id` in Django and Canvas must match. Use environment variables to avoid hardcoding.
- **Key Files:** Private and public keys must be in the correct format and location. Decode base64 keys if needed.
- **CSRF Trusted Origins:** Add your deployed domain and all Canvas domains to `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in Django settings.
- **Session & Cookies:** Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'None'` and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` for LTI in iframes.
- **target_link_uri:** Your OIDC login view must use the `target_link_uri` from the request if present.
- **Testing:** Always test LTI launch in Canvas Beta before production.
- **Environment Variables:** Set all required env vars (`CANVAS_CLIENT_ID`, secrets, etc.) in your deployment environment.
- **Key Rotation:** Document how to update/rotate keys and update Canvas Developer Key if needed.
